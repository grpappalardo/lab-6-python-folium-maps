In this lab I used the code tutorial to learn about in-notebook mapping with Folium and Pandas. The example with mapping Starbucks in Los Angeles County showed the problem
with using zip codes as borders for depicting density of a variable. Zip code boundaries do not relate to neighborhoods or common traffic flows and therefore can be unrelated to real-world trends. Thefore, I also created a more clear map just showing Starbucks in LA County as a whole, and a more effective use of chloropleth mapping by depicting state unemployment rates. I found this tutorial very educational as I learned about a new way of mapping and an important geoagraphic concept, the modifiable areal unit problem. The Folium Quickstart Guide hasinteresting options for map styles. I enjoyed using color to present a different design type for each map.
